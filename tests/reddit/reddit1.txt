Embattled Mark Robinson losing by double digits in North Carolina gubernatorial race

Hopefully this leads to Kamala winning NC

Either we are going to see an insane ticket split or Harris is gonna win because of low R turn out.

Robinson is so bad that I really do think he might just lead some GOP voters to stay home. Like, there had to be a "Screw all of this" sort of line that must exist somewhere for some people. I know, Trump's voters have pretty clearly demonstrated that most don't have any such line, but 2%? 3%? Maybe.

The enthusiasm gap is real. You can't just put up a bunch of unpleasant candidates and count on your base showing up because they usually do.

When you wonder why maga would lie about Biden withholding FEMA funds for North Carolina, this is a big reason.

Also, they seem to just enjoy lying.
