A drug used to prevent organ rejection in kidney transplant patients is being touted for potentially slowing down aging.
The immune-suppressing medication rapamycin, also known as sirolimus, is being used off-label as a means of extending longevity.
"By targeting a key pathway (mTOR) in cells, this drug has been shown to extend lifespan in animals and could be beneficial to prevent age-related diseases in humans," Dr. Andrea B. Maier — a professor in healthy aging and dementia research at the Director of the Centre for Healthy Longevity at the National University of Singapore — told Fox News Digital.
Maier was co-author of a recent review study that explored how rapamycin affected healthy humans.

The review, which was published in the journal Lancet Healthy Longevity, found that the medication improved the effects of aging on the skin.
"Rapamycin and its derivatives improve the immune and cardiovascular function of healthy individuals or individuals with aging-related diseases," Maier said in an email.
Daniel Tawfik, a molecular biologist and co-founder of Healthspan, a digital medical clinic that focuses on anti-aging and longevity-promoting therapies, said his team uses rapamycin to help slow down the rate of aging. 
"We view this through the lens of reducing the accumulation of damaged senescent cells," Tawfik, who is based in Santa Monica, California, told Fox News Digital.
